	<h2>History of Football</h2>
	<p>Football, also known as soccer in some parts of the world, has a long and rich history dating back thousands of years. The modern game of football was codified in England in the 19th century, with the formation of the first football clubs and the establishment of the first football leagues. Today, football is the most popular sport in the world, with millions of fans and players across the globe.</p>

	<h2>Football in the UK</h2>

The first recorded football match in England took place in 1863, and the Football Association (FA) was founded shortly thereafter. Today, football is the most popular sport in the UK, with numerous professional leagues and hundreds of amateur clubs.</p>
