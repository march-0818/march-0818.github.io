<h1>The History of Basketball and its Presence in the UK</h1>

<h2>History of Basketball</h2>
<p>Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. The first game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to a balcony 10 feet above the floor. The sport quickly gained popularity in the United States, and the first professional league, the National Basketball League (NBL), was established in 1937.</p>

<h2>Basketball in the UK</h2>
<p>The sport was first introduced to the UK by American and Canadian soldiers during World War II. The first recorded basketball game in the UK was played on December 30, 1936, between a US Army team and a local YMCA team in London. The British Basketball League (BBL) was founded in 1987 and has since grown to become the top professional basketball league in the UK.</p>
